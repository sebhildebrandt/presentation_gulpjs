This presentation covers:

1. What is gulp
2. Why gulp
3. The gulp API
4. gulp - "Hello World"
5. Creating a gulp boilerplate 
6. summary

#### Boilerplate (03_gulp_boilerplate)

##### Install dependencies:

All dev-dependencies are already defined in the package.json file. To install all dependencies, please do the following:

```bash
$ cd 03_gulp_boilerplate
$ npm install
```

##### Remarks: 

The template I used as a front-end sample, is a modified LUCID template. You can find the original template here:

[http://shapebootstrap.net/item/lucid-html5-and-bootstrap-responsive-template/](http://shapebootstrap.net/item/lucid-html5-and-bootstrap-responsive-template/)

The gulp boilerplate is still work in progress. Be sure to check also the latest versions.
